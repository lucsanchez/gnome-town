The **src/Components** folder contains the file **App.js** that it's where everything start
Inside the folder src and from top to bottom, you can find the **api** where I fetch the data. The **components** folder with main components (itemList and detail, custom hooks and providers)
I tried to show differents ways of get shared and use of React hooks

For styling I choose Material UI with makeStyles to add styles to the elements.
